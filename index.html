        <div class="subheading mb-5">Public Health AdministratorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Growing up I always wanted a job that would help people in need, when sirens of fire trucks or ambulances were coming through my neighborhood I was always happy to see them. I saw these firefighters, paramedics, EMTS, as heroes and I wanted to be like them. I realize I didnâ€™t have the physique to be a firefighter, but growing up I started to do my own research into the medical field. First I wanted to be a biomedical engineer since I wanted to build prosthetic arms, legs, hands, for those he didnâ€™t have one. I kept that dream for many years and I was sure I would go into college to pursue that dream. But that all changed when I went to high school and I was able to see many other professions. <br><br>

        In high school in my eleventh grade year I joined an afterschool internship with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center which was connected to my high school. We would leave in the beginning of sixth period and go to the Medical center till five in the evening. In the Medical Center we were selected to various departments to work at, in my first year I was placed in the Biomedical Imaging Research Institute. When I was at that department I was able to see many high end computers working on imaging. But besides working at the department we held lectures at the medical center that talked about other various medical professions in which there I was amazed by other professions that didnâ€™t need a lot of years in college. I job shadowed many researchers and I was able to go to the labs where MRIâ€™s were taken in which I was amazed on how technology really helped. But I learned that many of these engineers as well researchers spend many years in college and I knew that I did not want to do that. But I didnâ€™t want a profession that dealt with blood or any surgeries. But in one of the lectures we had, we had a public health official talk to us and I was interested in that profession. So I did a little research on it and I knew that it was the one<br><br>

        So I grew fond of public health, so that's why I applied to colleges that had public health or public policy as their majors. When I got accepted to UC Riverside I was stoked and was ready to take on the challenge. In my first years of college I was getting used to the environment since this will be my first time out of home. I made so many friends and the classes I took really helped get to where I am today. In my junior as well senior year I took an internship at our university medical center. I learned a lot from my mentors and gave me tips on how a public health administrator should act like. This is why I feel that I am the right candidate for the position. With my experiences I have during my high school and college years I already know what the medical world challenges me for.
